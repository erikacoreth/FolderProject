# Folder and File Management System

## Overview
The Folder and File Management System is a Python-based console application that simulates a basic file management environment. It allows users to create a hierarchical structure of folders and files, navigate through them, and display their contents. The system uses object-oriented programming concepts to manage the folder and file structures.

## Features
- **Folder Creation**: Create new subfolders within any existing folder.
- **File Addition**: Add files to any folder in the system.
- **Navigation**: Navigate through the folder hierarchy by selecting different folders.
- **Display Content**: Display all files and subfolders within a folder.
- **Object Counting**: Dynamically count all files and subfolders within the root or any subfolder.

## How to Run
To run this file management system, ensure that Python is installed on your system. Follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/folder-file-manager.git
    ```
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
    ```
    cd folder-file-manager
    ```
3. **Run the System**:
    ```
    python file_manager.py
    ```

## Usage Instructions
Upon running the application, you will be presented with a menu of options to interact with the folder/file system:
1. **Add File**: Add a file to the current folder.
2. **Add Subfolder**: Create a new subfolder within the current folder.
3. **Select Subfolder**: Change the current folder by navigating to one of its subfolders.
4. **Print Folder**: Display the entire content of the root folder, including all nested subfolders and files.
5. **Print Objects in Folder**: Display the total number of objects (files and subfolders) in the root folder.
6. **Exit**: Terminate the application.

## Development
This project is designed to teach file system navigation and manipulation using classes and recursion in Python. It illustrates key concepts such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism in object-oriented programming.
