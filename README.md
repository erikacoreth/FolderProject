This program implements a file management system where users can organize files and subfolders within a hierarchical folder structure. The Folder class represents individual folders, storing file names and subfolders, and provides methods to add files, add subfolders, and navigate through the hierarchy. It also includes special methods like __len__ to calculate the total number of items (files and subfolders) and __str__ for a readable representation of the folder structure. The FileManager class manages the system, starting with a root folder and allowing users to interact through a menu-driven interface. Users can add files, create subfolders, navigate to subfolders, print the entire folder hierarchy, and view the total number of items in the root folder. The program is recursive in handling subfolder structures, ensuring seamless organization and navigation.
